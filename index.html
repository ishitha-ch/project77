        <p> This is Visual Studio. It is a new coding platform that I am using. In Visual Studio, we write JS and HTML in the same file instead of different ones.</p>

        <p> The console is sort of an invisible workspace. It is not actually invisible and you can only open the console if you want to. You can store variables and other things inside of it. To open the console, right-click anywhere on the screen and click inspect. When the inspection screen pops up, click the console which will be on the top navigation bar.</p>
